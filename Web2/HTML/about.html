            <h2>OUR HISTORY</h2>
            <p>
              AO Motors was founded in 2005 to respond to the needs in the
              industry and facilitate the travel experience. Our organization
              started with a vision that prioritizes dynamism in the sector and
              customer satisfaction. Since then, we have continued our mission
              of providing excellent service to our customers at every stage. We
              initially started operating with a limited vehicle fleet and at a
              local level. However, we have continuously improved in line with
              our customer satisfaction-oriented approach and rapidly changing
              industry demands. In the first years, unlike other companies in
              the sector, we expanded our vehicle categories to offer more
              options to our customers and took care to provide services at
              affordable prices. In 2008, we discovered the power of the
              internet and started to provide services on the online platform.
              This has allowed us to offer our customers an easier, faster and
              more accessible booking experience. With the development of
              technology, we have taken steps to make our customers' travel
              plans even easier by investing in mobile applications and online
              reservation systems. By adapting to the changing needs in the
              industry, we adopted a sustainability-focused approach in 2015. We
              have taken steps towards becoming an environmentally friendly
              company with the environmentally friendly vehicles and green
              practices we added to our fleet. Today, we have a large fleet of
              vehicles and serve many locations across the country. While
              maintaining our goal of being a pioneer in the industry with
              innovative solutions, we continue to keep our customers'
              satisfaction at the highest level. In the future, we aim to follow
              technological innovations, create a more comprehensive service
              network, grow based on sustainability and customer satisfaction,
              and always improve the travel experience.
